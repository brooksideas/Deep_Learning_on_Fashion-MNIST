# Deep_Learning_on_Fashion-MNIST

Train a neural network on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using the PyTorch framework and the Adam optimizer.

Here's a brief explanation of the differences between the optimization algorithms you mentioned: Nesterov momentum, RMSProp, Adam, and BFGS:

1. **Nesterov Momentum:**

   - **Pros:**
     - It's an extension of traditional momentum that helps accelerate convergence by considering the future gradient at an adjusted position.
     - Can handle noisy gradients well and converge faster than vanilla SGD.
     - Offers better stability and typically results in better generalization.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires tuning of the momentum parameter.
     - Can overshoot the minimum in certain situations.

2. **RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation):**

   - **Pros:**
     - Adaptive learning rate: It adapts the learning rates for each parameter individually, helping to converge quickly and effectively on a variety of optimization surfaces.
     - Effective in dealing with sparse data and varying gradients.
   - **Cons:**
     - May require tuning of additional hyperparameters like the decay rate.
     - Less popular than Adam in some applications.

3. **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation):**

   - **Pros:**
     - Combines the benefits of both momentum and RMSProp, offering adaptive learning rates and momentum.
     - Effective in practice for a wide range of deep learning tasks.
     - Requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and often works well with defaults.
   - **Cons:**
     - Some sensitivity to the learning rate, although the default value often suffices.
     - Can exhibit noisy behavior on certain loss surfaces.

4. **BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno):**
   - **Pros:**
     - A quasi-Newton method that approximates the Hessian matrix, making it suitable for nonconvex optimization.
     - Converges efficiently on smooth, well-behaved surfaces.
   - **Cons:**
     - Requires computation and storage of the Hessian matrix, which can be memory-intensive for large networks.
     - Not as commonly used in deep learning due to its computational requirements.
     - Prone to saddle points and might struggle with highly nonconvex loss surfaces, unlike stochastic gradient-based methods like Adam.

In summary, Nesterov momentum, RMSProp, and Adam are more commonly used in training neural networks due to their effectiveness, ease of use, and adaptability to different tasks. BFGS, on the other hand, is a more traditional optimization algorithm that can work well on convex problems but is less commonly used in deep learning due to its computational demands and limitations on highly nonconvex surfaces. The choice of the algorithm often depends on the specific problem and empirical performance.
